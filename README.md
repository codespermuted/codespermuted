# 👋 Hello, I'm Jaehong Yu

I'm a machine learning and applied statistics researcher with a strong interest in building **practical, interpretable, and deployable models**. My work focuses on solving real-world problems in biomedical, pharmaceutical and other challenging domains.

I’m particularly interested in:

- **Uncertainty quantification** in neural networks and predictive models
- **Federated learning** convergency efficiecy and privacy-preserving model development
- **Statistical modeling with interpretability** emphasizing techniques that are explainable and scientifically grounded

## 🔬 Selected Projects

- 🔍 **[SF-Rx](https://github.com/codespermuted/SF-RX)**  
  A multi-output deep neural network framework for predicting drug–drug interactions under realistic, heterogeneous conditions.

- 🧠 **[NeuroRG](https://github.com/codespermuted/NeuroRG)**  
  An image based deep learning-based pipeline for morphological profiling of CNS cells, facilitating anti-inflammatory compound screening.

- 📊 **[AIDA-attn](https://github.com/codespermuted/AIDA-attn)**  
  An interpretable attention-based deep learning model designed for high-dimensional time-series data, enhancing feature-level understanding.

- 🧬 **[ZIBseq](https://github.com/codespermuted/ZIBseq)**  
  Implementation of zero-inflated beta regression for metagenomic differential abundance analysis.  
  This was developed as a methodologically improved extension to an existing tool, and tried to be contributed via pull request to the original project.
